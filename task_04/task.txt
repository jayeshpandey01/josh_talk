Question - 4) Here, you are given transcriptions from five ASR models for the same audio and
a human reference, which may contain errors.
● Design an approach (theory + pseudocode/code) to:
● Construct a lattice that captures all valid transcription alternatives from the model
outputs.
● Handle insertions, deletions, and substitutions in a way that does not unfairly penalize
models when the reference is wrong.
● Decide when to trust model agreement over the reference.
Choose and justify the alignment unit (word / subword / phrase). Then compute WER for each
model using lattice based transcription and model output
