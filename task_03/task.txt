Question-3
Background
In a subset of our Hindi conversational dataset, which was human transcribed we have
identified ~1,77,000 unique words (here). Some of these words are obvious spelling mistakes.

Our goal is to improve transcription accuracy of our dataset. One proposed approach is to
separate these words into two groups:
● Words that have 100% accurate spelling
● Words that are incorrect because they contain spelling mistakes
The idea is that once we identify the words with errors, we can go back to the corresponding
audio segments and selectively re-human transcribe only those segments, rather than redoing
the entire dataset.
Keep in mind that in our transcription guidelines: English words spoken in the conversation
are transcribed in Devanagari script. For example, “computer” spoken in English should
appear as “कंप्यटू र.” In such cases, the Devanagari transcription counts as the correct spelling,
not an error.
Your Task
Identify which of the 1,75,000 words are correctly spelled vs. incorrectly spelled. Share the
approach you undertook to come to this conclusion.
Deliverables
a. Share the final number of unique correct spelled words in the dataset
b. A google sheet containing 2 columns, one with the the final list of unique words and
second making them as ‘correct spelling’ and ‘incorrect spelling’
We are looking for your ability to combine linguistic reasoning with practical data-cleaning
strategies that balance accuracy and efficiency.
